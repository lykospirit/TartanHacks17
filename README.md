# The SIO App

Have you ever wanted to check your class schedule to find out which classroom you need to go to? Has it ever been a Saturday and you have no idea how many meal blocks you have left to clear? Or, perhaps, you would just like to know how to contact the Campus Police or CaPS in an emergency?

Fret not: with the SIO app, you no longer need to whip out your hefty PC / Mac / odd Linux-based mess of wires and metal to find out! Access all the information you need on the SIO easily from your mobile device!
